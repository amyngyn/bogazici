        Hi, my name is Amy Nguyen! I am a computer science student at Stanford University and I love teaching! In August, I will be starting my first full-time job as a software engineer in San Francisco and I am excited to use my skills as an engineer to bring joy to millions of people. I also really love coffee, writing, and learning new languages. Ben kedileri seviyorum!
